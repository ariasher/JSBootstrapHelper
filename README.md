# JSBootstrapHelper-
A JavaScript helper library for Bootstrap 3.3.7 class names and Glyphicons that come bundled with Bootstrap 3. This library helps to refer names of Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4 and Glyphicon classes very easily without having you to memorize the class name. Add the script as a source and use it.

Info: 
$b3 refers to Bootstrap 3 classes.
$b4 refers to Bootstrap 4 classes. Reserved for future use.
$glyphicon refers to Glyphicon classes. Used with Bootstrap 3 as it is not supported with Bootstrap 4.
